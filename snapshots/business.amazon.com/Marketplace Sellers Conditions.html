<span class="a-list-item"><strong>SHIPPING; RETURNS; REPLACEMENT CHARGES; PAYMENT METHODS; TAXES. </strong>Your purchases are subject to Amazon&rsquo;s Shipping and Returns Policies. All purchases of physical items from Amazon are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier. Unless you are participating in the Pay by Invoice service, payment for all purchases made through your Business Account is due upon shipment or on the date indicated on the checkout page, or, for digital products, when we make the digital product available to you. For returns, Amazon does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, Amazon does not take title to the refunded item. To purchase through Amazon Business, you will need at least one valid payment method associated with your Business Account; if there is a problem charging your selected payment method for any purchase, we may charge any other valid payment method associated with your Business Account. If we send any User a replacement product for a product they originally ordered using an individual payment method (such as a personal credit card) and the original product ordered is not returned within 30 days of the replacement request, you acknowledge and consent that we may charge any eligible payment method on record for the relevant User Account for the replacement product. Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this Agreement.<p></p>

<strong>7.1. Customer Information.</strong> We require you to provide information about you and your Users to access and use Amazon Business, and you may need to provide supplemental information to use or purchase some Amazon Business products or services. You will ensure that all information that you provide to us is at all times accurate and complete. We may share information you provide (for example, your organization&rsquo;s name, addresses, Taxpayer Identification Number) with others in your organization and third parties to confirm the accuracy of such information and your eligibility to use Amazon Business or certain services (for example, to confirm you hold a valid license, certification, or credential where required). To enable us to improve our services, including by making available additional product selection or business pricing, we may share specific order information about the products or services you purchase through your Business Account with the suppliers who provide such products or services. For example, for certain transactions, Amazon Business may share your organization&rsquo;s name or credentials, shipping address, shipment date, ASIN/SKU, quantity or other relevant information. </p>

<p>
<strong>7.2. Privacy.</strong> Except as disclosed in this Agreement, our use of your information is governed by the terms of the Amazon.com Privacy Notice. Please review the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496" target="_blank">Privacy Notice</a> to understand our practices with respect to your information.

<span class="a-list-item"><strong>GOVERNING LAW, DISPUTES, GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES.</strong>
<p>
<strong>8.1. Governing Law.</strong> The laws of the State of Washington, without reference to conflict of law rules, as well as the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, govern the Agreement and any dispute that might arise between you and us that pertains to Amazon Business or this Agreement. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the Agreement.</p>

<p>
<strong>8.2. Disputes.</strong> Any dispute or claim relating in any way to Amazon Business or this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules (available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879). An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages). You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or at a mutually agreed location. We and you agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If, for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We and you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>

<p>
<strong>8.3. Public Sector Entities.</strong> If you are a public sector entity and precluded by law from agreeing to any of the provisions of Section 8 as set forth above, then any disputes with you will be governed by the substantive laws of the sovereign under whose laws you were formed and the venue for any such dispute will be the venue required by the laws of such sovereign. Similarly, if the laws of such sovereign would result in other provisions in this Agreement being deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable against you, those provisions will not apply to you and will be deemed severable from this Agreement. All other provisions in the Agreement remain in full force and effect.</p>
